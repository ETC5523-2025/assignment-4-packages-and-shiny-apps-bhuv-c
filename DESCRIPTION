Description: Provides a clean, compact dataset ('Data') of Disability-Adjusted

    (HAP, SSI, BSI, UTI, CDI) across two surveillance studies (German PPS and
    ECDC PPS). Includes a packaged Shiny app ('inst/app') to explore YLD
    (Years Lived with Disability) and YLL (Years of Life Lost). Developed for
    ETC5523: Communicating with Data (Monash University).
