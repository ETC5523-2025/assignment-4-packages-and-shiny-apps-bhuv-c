    Interactive Shiny dashboard built for ETC5523 — *Communicating with Data* (Monash University).
    It visualises **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** per 100,000 population for
    five healthcare-associated infections (HAP, SSI, BSI, UTI, CDI), split into
    **YLD** (Years Lived with Disability) and **YLL** (Years of Life Lost),
    comparing **German PPS** and **ECDC PPS (EU/EEA)** datasets.
