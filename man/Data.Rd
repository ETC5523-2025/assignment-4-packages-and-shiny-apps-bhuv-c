\usage{
Data
}
\description{
The dataset contains Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population
for five major healthcare-associated infections — HAP, SSI, BSI, UTI, and CDI —
across two surveillance studies: the German PPS and the ECDC PPS (EU/EEA).
}
\details{
Each infection’s burden is represented by two DALY components:
\itemize{
\item \strong{YLD (Years Lived with Disability)} – measures morbidity or time lived in less than full health.
\item \strong{YLL (Years of Life Lost)} – measures premature mortality due to infection.
}

The dataset supports analysis and visualisation of infection burden
across surveillance regions, including uncertainty through standard error values.
