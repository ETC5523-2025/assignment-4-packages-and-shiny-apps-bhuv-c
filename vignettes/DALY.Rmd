**Overview**

The DALY package was developed as part of the Monash University unit ETC5523 – Communicating with Data.

It provides a clean dataset of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population for five healthcare-associated infections, as well as a fully packaged interactive Shiny dashboard for exploring the burden of disease across infections and regions.

**Dataset description**

The dataset Data contains DALY estimates across two surveillance studies:
	•	German PPS – Point prevalence survey conducted in Germany.
	•	ECDC PPS (EU/EEA) – European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control survey.

Each infection is represented by two DALY components:
	•	YLD (Years Lived with Disability) — the years lived in less than full health.
	•	YLL (Years of Life Lost) — the years lost due to premature death.

Variable Description group Study group (German PPS, ECDC PPS) category
Infection type (HAP, SSI, BSI, UTI, CDI) component DALY component (YLD,
YLL) value DALYs per 100,000 population se Standard error for the total
(used for error bars)

The dataset allows comparison between infections and regions, showing
how YLD and YLL contribute to the overall burden.

**Example usage**

```r
# View the dataset
head(Data)

# Summarise total DALYs per infection
library(dplyr)
Data |>
  group_by(category) |>
  summarise(Total_DALY = sum(value), .groups = "drop")
```

You can use the data for static analysis in R or open the packaged Shiny
dashboard to interactively explore it.

**Launching the interactive app**

Run the included Shiny dashboard 

```r
run_app()
```

This launches an interactive web application with:

-    Bar charts showing DALYs per infection type, split by YLD and YLL.

-    Error bars representing uncertainty in total DALYs.

-    Tabs for both visualisation and raw data view.

**Source**

The data were adapted from:

Zacher, B., et al. (2019). Application of a new methodology and R
package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI)
in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European
Economic Area, 2011 to 2012. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection

**Summary**

This package illustrates best practices in:

-   Data documentation using roxygen2

-    Reproducible packaging with usethis

-    Interactive communication via Shiny + bslib
