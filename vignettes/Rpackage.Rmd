**Overview**

This vignette accompanies the Rpackage created for the unit ETC5523 –
Communicating with Data (Monash University). It demonstrates how to
access the built-in dataset Data and how to launch the included
interactive Shiny dashboard for exploring Disability-Adjusted Life Years
(DALYs) across major infection types.

**Dataset description**

The Data dataset contains estimates of DALYs per 100,000 population for
five healthcare-associated infections, reported by two surveillance
studies:

-    German PPS – Point prevalence survey from Germany.

<!-- -->

-    ECDC PPS – Point prevalence survey across EU/EEA countries.

Each infection type is further split into the DALY components:

-   YLD (Years Lived with Disability)

-   YLL (Years of Life Lost)

Variable Description group Study group (German PPS, ECDC PPS) category
Infection type (HAP, SSI, BSI, UTI, CDI) component DALY component (YLD,
YLL) value DALYs per 100,000 population se Standard error for the total
(used for error bars)

The dataset allows comparison between infections and regions, showing
how YLD and YLL contribute to the overall burden.

**Example usage**

head(Data)

You can use the data for static analysis in R or open the packaged Shiny
dashboard to interactively explore it.

**Launching the interactive app**

Run the included Shiny dashboard run_app()

This launches an interactive web application with:

-    Bar charts showing DALYs per infection type, split by YLD and YLL.

-    Error bars representing uncertainty in total DALYs.

-    Tabs for both visualisation and raw data view.

**Source**

The data were adapted from:

Zacher, B., et al. (2019). Application of a new methodology and R
package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI)
in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European
Economic Area, 2011 to 2012. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection
Control, 8(1), 73.

**Summary**

This package illustrates best practices in:

-   Data documentation using roxygen2

-    Reproducible packaging with usethis

-    Interactive communication via Shiny + bslib
